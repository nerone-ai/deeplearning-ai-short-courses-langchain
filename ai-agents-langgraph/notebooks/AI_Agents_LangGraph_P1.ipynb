    "# AI Agents in LangGraph – Introduction & Lesson 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes from the short course on building **AI agents** with the **LangGraph** extension of LangChain. Recent progress in **function‑calling LLMs** and purpose‑built tools (e.g. agent‑aware search) has made agentic applications *predictable* and *stable* to run in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successful teams follow a handful of design patterns:\n",
    "1. **Planning** – break the goal into executable steps.\n",
    "2. **Tool use** – route calls to well‑defined interfaces (APIs, search, calculators…).\n",
    "3. **Reflection** – critique and refine intermediate results.\n",
    "4. **Multi‑agent collaboration** – specialise roles (planner, researcher, writer…).\n",
    "5. **Memory & persistence** – record state for long‑running tasks and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** lets users express cyclic graphs that capture these patterns declaratively, while still using LangChain’s rich ecosystem of tools and observability hooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Lesson 1* a minimal **ReAct** agent is build from scratch. Future lessons will re‑implement it with LangGraph and extend it with the patterns above."
